# RobotJS - OSRS Rat Slayer Bot üêÄ‚öîÔ∏è

This repository uses [Robot.js](https://robotjs.io/) to automate mouse and keyboard inputs ( [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) is used as a run-time. )

- `npm install` to install the required packages
- `npm start` will run the script in `index.js`

**Important:**

- This bot has been tested on the standard OSRS client ( **Not RuneLite.** ) on a 1920 x 1080 Resolution Display, Windows 10.
